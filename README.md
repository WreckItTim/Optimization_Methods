# Optimization_Methods
python code for line search, trust region, BFGS, and others

Each method is modulated to switch out various submethods, such as how to find step size and direction.

I followed the algorithms found in the book cited below, and constantly reference to page numbers for each method:
Nocedal, Jorge, and Stephen J. Wright. Numerical optimization. New York: Springer, 2006. Print.

Done in a python notebook with examples at end, including visual represenations of the optimization search.
